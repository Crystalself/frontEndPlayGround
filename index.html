    <dd>most of my time i war was used here, after mainly using it for news, and after sometime of no entertainment or good internet it tried to search for some manga names in telegram search, and behold I truly found them channel containing all chapters as pdf, well lucky me that I like reading in english as most channels are so.

    <dd>it's fun how my asking google for random stuff changed to asking ai for random stuff, well mostly because it
        enables me to ask follow up questions.

<p>PS:I do work in web development I am a back end programmer, and based on my friend who works with me front end, tailwind is so much better than bootstrap maybe you should give it a thought till we reach that time.</p><p hidden>PS:you know I had wrote a lot in here but i removed it before submission life should go on. when you see someone sad about a loved one say:"don't worry it's just three hours and your loved one will see you again, how you ask? didn't our prophet peace be upon him say that the time after death till judgment day in the grave is like between asr and maghrib.</p>
